# Contributing to SwiftSharp

Thank you for considering contributing to **SwiftSharp**! SwiftSharp is a growing ecosystem for C# that draws inspiration from Swift’s design principles. It aims to provide powerful utilities, frameworks, and tools for developers. Contributions are welcome from everyone—whether it’s fixing bugs, adding new functionality, improving documentation, or optimizing performance.

## How to Contribute

1. **Fork the repository** and clone it locally.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/DevByEagle/SwiftSharp.git

- `net8.0`
- `netstandard2.1`

3. **Create a feature branch**:
